## Objective

👨🏽‍💻
I am an IT enthusiast and Cybersecurity student with a strong interest in SOC operations and network defence. I am currently developing my skills through academic projects, online certifications and research, with a particular focus on secure infrastructure and emerging technologies.

💡 Key Interests: Cybersecurity, Networking, SOC, IT Support, GRC
🧠 Current Focus: Threat analysis, network security, Microsoft, Linux, Python, help desk support
🎯 Long Term Goal: SOC Analyst, Network Engineer, Cloud Engineer, GRC Specialist

👨🏽‍🏫
Alongside my studies, I work as a Teaching Assistant, Cover Supervisor, Remote Exam Invigilator and 1:1 Tutor (including SEN support) for multiple London-based staffing agencies. These roles have strengthened my communication, adaptability and leadership, which are valuable in both educational and technical environments.

Whether I am researching future technologies, securing systems or supporting learners, I am driven by problem solving, curiosity and continuous development.

🤝 Keen to engage with others in the tech and education space.

## 📁 Projects

### 💻 ProManage Flask App
Collaborated on a project management system with login, registration, and task dashboards. Developed the front-end in Flask and implemented secure login logic with hashed passwords and role-based access.

### 🧠 Buffer Overflow Exploitation
Reverse engineered a C-based authentication program and used GDB, cyclic patterns, and return address control to bypass login and execute shellcode. Analysed stack canaries and ASLR protections.

### 🌐 Secure Network Design
Configured a corporate network using Cisco Packet Tracer with OSPF, VLANs, ACLs, and a Zone-Based Policy Firewall. Implemented role-restricted SSH and DMZ segmentation to simulate enterprise-grade defence.

### 📊 Cyber Threats to UK Institutions Report
Analysed case studies involving ransomware, phishing, and other cyber threats against UK public sector. Proposed mitigation strategies using MFA, network segmentation, and user awareness campaigns.

### 🖼️ ImageCraft (Python Image Editor)  
Built a GUI image editor using Tkinter and PIL with secure PIN login, grayscale/blur filters, and file validation. Designed modular architecture with built-in error handling and secure file operations.

### 🐍 Snake Maths Game (Pygame + Tkinter)  
Developed a real-time arithmetic game for KS2 learners inspired by the classic Snake game. Included category-based question generation, dynamic difficulty scaling, user login, and leaderboard tracking.

### 🛫 OS Proposition (RTOS for Drones)  
Designed a conceptual real-time operating system (RTOS) for autonomous drones focusing on memory isolation, scheduling algorithms, and embedded safety mechanisms using priority queues and interrupt handling.

### 🧮 Linux Terminal Lifecycle Analysis  
Analysed the execution of `cp -vi .bashrc bashrc.bak` to explore Linux process lifecycles. Used shell output to trace `fork()`, `exec()`, file permissions, context switching, and privilege boundaries between user and kernel space.
