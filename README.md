Hello, I'm Yasir

Objective

I am a second-year Cyber Security student at the University of Warwick. I am currently interning with Cyber PATH at the Cyber Resilience Centre for the West Midlands and Cyber London. I previously interned at WMG, University of Warwick, where I contributed to an impact case study for the REF, and at Parisi, where I worked on AI risk modelling and governance.

I strengthen my skills through academic work, hands-on security projects, certifications, and labs, and I rank in the Top 2% on TryHackMe. My experience covers threat analysis, incident response, vulnerability assessments, secure configuration, network defence, and technical teaching.

🔐 Interests: Cybersecurity, Networking, SOC, IT Support, GRC
⚙️ Current Focus: Threat analysis, network security, Microsoft, Linux, Python, help desk operations
🎯 Career Goals: SOC Analyst, Network Engineer, Cloud Engineer, GRC Specialist

Alongside technical roles, I work as a Teaching Assistant, Cover Supervisor, Remote Exam Invigilator, and 1:1 Tutor. These positions have strengthened my communication, adaptability, and problem-solving while supporting learners at different stages.

I am driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and real-world impact. I enjoy collaborating on security and education projects.

## 📁 Projects

### 💻 ProManage Flask App
Collaborated on a project management system with login, registration, and task dashboards. Developed the front-end in Flask and implemented secure login logic with hashed passwords and role-based access.

### 🧠 Buffer Overflow Exploitation
Reverse engineered a C-based authentication program and used GDB, cyclic patterns, and return address control to bypass login and execute shellcode. Analysed stack canaries and ASLR protections.

### 🌐 Secure Network Design
Configured a corporate network using Cisco Packet Tracer with OSPF, VLANs, ACLs, and a Zone-Based Policy Firewall. Implemented role-restricted SSH and DMZ segmentation to simulate enterprise-grade defence.

### 📊 Cyber Threats to UK Institutions Report
Analysed case studies involving ransomware, phishing, and other cyber threats against UK public sector. Proposed mitigation strategies using MFA, network segmentation, and user awareness campaigns.

### 🖼️ ImageCraft (Python Image Editor)  
Built a GUI image editor using Tkinter and PIL with secure PIN login, grayscale/blur filters, and file validation. Designed modular architecture with built-in error handling and secure file operations.

### 🐍 Snake Maths Game (Pygame + Tkinter)  
Developed a real-time arithmetic game for KS2 learners inspired by the classic Snake game. Included category-based question generation, dynamic difficulty scaling, user login, and leaderboard tracking.

### 🛫 OS Proposition (RTOS for Drones)  
Designed a conceptual real-time operating system (RTOS) for autonomous drones focusing on memory isolation, scheduling algorithms, and embedded safety mechanisms using priority queues and interrupt handling.

### 🧮 Linux Terminal Lifecycle Analysis  
Analysed the execution of `cp -vi .bashrc bashrc.bak` to explore Linux process lifecycles. Used shell output to trace `fork()`, `exec()`, file permissions, context switching, and privilege boundaries between user and kernel space.

### 🛠️ DevSecOps — TryHackMe “On-Prem IaC” Challenge  
Completed the TryHackMe On-Prem IaC lab: analysed **Vagrant** + **Ansible** provisioning of a Dockerised **Flask + MySQL** app, tunnelled into the private network, exploited a command-injection to gain a reverse shell, recovered synced SSH keys, pivoted across the internal Docker/Vagrant network, and escalated privileges to capture flags.
