## Objective
I’m an IT and Cybersecurity student at Warwick University with a keen interest in SOC operations, secure infrastructure, and network defence. I actively build my skills through academic projects, hands-on labs, certifications, and research, focusing on emerging technologies and threat analysis.

🔐 Interests: Cybersecurity, Networking, SOC, IT Support, GRC

⚙️ Current Focus: Threat analysis, network security, Microsoft, Linux, Python, help desk operations

🎯 Career Goals: SOC Analyst, Network Engineer, Cloud Engineer, GRC Specialist

Alongside my studies, I work as a Teaching Assistant, Cover Supervisor, Remote Exam Invigilator, and 1:1 Tutor (including SEN support) for various London-based agencies. These experiences have strengthened my leadership, adaptability, and communication—key qualities in both education and technical environments.

Whether I’m exploring future tech, securing systems, or supporting learners, I’m driven by curiosity, continuous development, and real-world impact.

🤝 I enjoy collaborating within tech and education spaces. Feel free to connect if you’d like to discuss projects, ideas, or opportunities.

## 📁 Projects

### 💻 ProManage Flask App
Collaborated on a project management system with login, registration, and task dashboards. Developed the front-end in Flask and implemented secure login logic with hashed passwords and role-based access.

### 🧠 Buffer Overflow Exploitation
Reverse engineered a C-based authentication program and used GDB, cyclic patterns, and return address control to bypass login and execute shellcode. Analysed stack canaries and ASLR protections.

### 🌐 Secure Network Design
Configured a corporate network using Cisco Packet Tracer with OSPF, VLANs, ACLs, and a Zone-Based Policy Firewall. Implemented role-restricted SSH and DMZ segmentation to simulate enterprise-grade defence.

### 📊 Cyber Threats to UK Institutions Report
Analysed case studies involving ransomware, phishing, and other cyber threats against UK public sector. Proposed mitigation strategies using MFA, network segmentation, and user awareness campaigns.

### 🖼️ ImageCraft (Python Image Editor)  
Built a GUI image editor using Tkinter and PIL with secure PIN login, grayscale/blur filters, and file validation. Designed modular architecture with built-in error handling and secure file operations.

### 🐍 Snake Maths Game (Pygame + Tkinter)  
Developed a real-time arithmetic game for KS2 learners inspired by the classic Snake game. Included category-based question generation, dynamic difficulty scaling, user login, and leaderboard tracking.

### 🛫 OS Proposition (RTOS for Drones)  
Designed a conceptual real-time operating system (RTOS) for autonomous drones focusing on memory isolation, scheduling algorithms, and embedded safety mechanisms using priority queues and interrupt handling.

### 🧮 Linux Terminal Lifecycle Analysis  
Analysed the execution of `cp -vi .bashrc bashrc.bak` to explore Linux process lifecycles. Used shell output to trace `fork()`, `exec()`, file permissions, context switching, and privilege boundaries between user and kernel space.

### 🛠️ DevSecOps — TryHackMe “On-Prem IaC” Challenge  
Completed the TryHackMe On-Prem IaC lab: analysed **Vagrant** + **Ansible** provisioning of a Dockerised **Flask + MySQL** app, tunnelled into the private network, exploited a command-injection to gain a reverse shell, recovered synced SSH keys, pivoted across the internal Docker/Vagrant network, and escalated privileges to capture flags.
